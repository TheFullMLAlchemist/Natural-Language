# TRAC-1-COLING

As the number of people and this interaction over the web has increased, incidents of aggression and related activities like trolling, cyberbullying, flaming, hate speech, etc. have also increased manifold across the globe. The reach and extent of Internet has given such incidents unprecedented power and influence to affect the lives of billions of people. We are happy to announce that we are organising the First Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying at 27thInternational Conference of Computational Linguistics (COLING â€“ 2018) in New Mexico, USA on 20 / 21 August, 2018, focussing on these and other related phenomena, in both text (especially social media) and speech.
